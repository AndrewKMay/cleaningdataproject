# README

This is a repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

In this repository, you should find:

- A codebook (CodeBook.md) explaining the original data and how they were tidied to produce the tidy data set
- A tidy data set (tidydata.csv and tidydata.txt)
- An R script providing the code used to tidy the data (run_analysis.R).
- This README.md file

The run_analysis.R script can be run in a working directory containing the UCI HAR folder of raw data. Execution of the script should generate the final tidy data set in both .csv and .txt formats. The codebook provides a description of the original data, the tidying process, and the final tidy data set.
